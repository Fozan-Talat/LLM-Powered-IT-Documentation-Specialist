**Business Requirements Document (BRD)**

**Project Name:** Data-Driven Marketing Enhancement Project

**Project Scope:**
The project aims to enhance data-driven marketing strategies to increase revenue and reduce operational costs through more efficient data handling processes. This includes implementing advanced analytics features for customer segmentation, robust backend support for handling increased data flows, and stringent security measures to mitigate risks such as data breaches.

**Objectives:**
1. Realize a return on investment within one year post-implementation.
2. Increase revenue through enhanced data-driven marketing strategies.
3. Reduce operational costs via more efficient data handling processes.
4. Ensure at least 90% positive feedback on usability and functionality from initial user groups through user acceptance testing.

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Implement advanced analytics features for customer segmentation.
2. Provide robust backend support for handling increased data flows.
3. Enhance data-driven marketing strategies.
4. Implement stringent security measures to mitigate risks such as data breaches.
5. Conduct user acceptance testing with at least 90% positive feedback.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
1. Time constraints must be addressed effectively.
2. Technical debt in the current system should be considered to avoid delays in integration efforts.
3. Agile project management techniques should be utilized for flexibility and rapid response to issues.

**Assumptions:**
1. Stakeholders include internal teams such as IT and customer service, as well as external partners and end-users.
2. Detailed discussions with each stakeholder group will be conducted to gather requirements effectively.

**Constraints:**
1. Time constraints, as mentioned by the Project Manager, Alex Johnson.
2. Technical debt in the current system may delay integration efforts.
3. Effective resource allocation is crucial, considering the possibility of additional staffing or outsourcing developments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User acceptance testing results must show at least 90% positive feedback on usability and functionality.
2. Project milestones should be met within the specified timeframes.
3. Security measures should be implemented from the outset to mitigate risks effectively.
